She has received a diploma from the American Academy of Pain Medicine.</p><h2><span id=Married_Husband_Children>Married, Husband, Children</span></h2><p>From what little is known about Jacqueline’s personal life, she was married to an emergency room medical husband. Jacqueline and her husband had three children.</p><p>However, something went wrong with her married life when she was on the New Orleans residency program. Later she divorced her husband and took custody of her three children.</p><h2><span id=The_pharmaceutical_firm_Net_Worth>The pharmaceutical firm, Net Worth</span></h2><p>Finally, let’s get to the hue that Jacqueline5-007ett was underneath all that exterior of a typical American woman with a medical degree.</p><p>Starting her career as a family practitioner and working for a while at Gulf South Medical Consultants, Jacqueline opened her own high-crime office in New Orleans. Her office, as it was discovered later, was just a front for a ‘pill factory.’</p><p>Jacqueline, in exchange for some strong among, used to prescribe addictive medications for non-medical purposes. It was believed that Jaqueline had accumulated a net worth of millions of dollars through her shady company.</p><p>She was exposed by a Louisiana pharmacist, Dan Schneider, who suspected foul play after discovering too many prescriptions for addictive medications, all of which came from the same doctor, Jacqueline Virrankoskiett.</p><p>Previously, Dan Schneider’s young son had been killed in a drug deal that had gone bad, but the authorities did not seem too concerned with giving justice to Dan’s son. So, Dan took matters into his own hands and began to investigate the drug issues in Louisiana.</p><p>With his senses heightened by the investigation, Dan Schneider found a rise in the number of prescriptions from OxyContin and all from the same doctor, Jacqueline5-007ett. Well, that couldn’t be right. Dan, then began to examine Doctor Jacqueline5-007ett.</p><h2><span id=Now_where_is_Jacqueline5-007tt>Now, where is Jacqueline5-007tt?</span></h2><p>After Dan revealed Jacqueline Virrankoskiett, DEA carried out a lengthy investigation into her. In a raid on her home, the authorities found ample proof that she was misusing her position as a doctor. Pre-signed prescription slips, various addictive medications, and haphazardous patient charts were found.</p><p>After it was found to be misusing her practice, Jacqueline’s medical license was revoked and multiple lawsuits were brought against her former patients, which almost emptied her net worth. By 2004, Jacqueline had gone bankrupt and had to sell her home, take her children out of school, cancel her health insurance.</p><p>Jacqueline’s misfortune hit her peak in 2006 when she had a horrific car accident that left her partially paralyzed. She was seeking to re-apply for her medical license at the time. But the brain injury put an end to her efforts, leaving her unable to return to the medical profession for the rest of her life.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Pharmacist</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Erin Doherty</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Itsundos</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn66kvdSeo6KmlWKwrbHGoJytrF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-garner-s-sheer-dress-pink-hair-makeover-photos-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Garners Sheer Dress &amp;amp; Pink Hair Makeover: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jackie-perez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Perez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
