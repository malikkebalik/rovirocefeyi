The opening line, "She don't want me to leave her, but I do bad all by myself," suggests that he recognizes the toxic nature of his relationships but ultimately chooses to prioritize his own well-being. He acknowledges that he has the power to touch people's souls through his music, symbolized by the key hanging from his belt, indicating his influence and success.</p><br><p>The lyrics also touch upon LUCKI's addiction to lean, a mixture of cough syrup and soda, which he highlights as an expensive habit. He mentions how a pretty girl is scared of him when she sees him asleep, implying that his drug use affects his appearance and behavior. Despite the references to his addiction, he acknowledges that he saves his life by using Jeeps, possibly referring to seeking solace or escape through driving.</p><br><p>There are references to the opinions and criticisms he receives from others, particularly the perception that he glorifies drug use. In response, LUCKI asserts that he is not responsible for the choices of others and dismisses them as jokes. He humorously mentions laughing all the way to the bank while spending money on expensive drinks and accessories.</p><br><p>Overall, "Leave Her" delves into LUCKI's complex relationships, his reflection on his own behavior, and his ability to impact others through his music. It suggests that he is aware of his personal struggles and is willing to prioritize his own well-being despite the desire of others to keep him close.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean
