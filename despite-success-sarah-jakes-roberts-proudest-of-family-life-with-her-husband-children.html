After her divorce, she found love again and married <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Touré&nbsp;Roberts</a> in 2014. Touré also has&nbsp;three children from his previous relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>A Happy Family Of Six</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Sarah <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">once posted on Facebook</a>&nbsp;that she was very nervous when their children first met. The couple had planned a trip to Disneyland, hoping all their children would get along well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On the trip, she realized that Touré accepted her children as his own. She understood&nbsp;that he was an&nbsp;incredible father, and the&nbsp;rest is history. The couple has come&nbsp;a long way since. From attending graduations to planning birthday parties, they are like any other regular family.&nbsp;</p><p>The blended family&nbsp;of five welcomed a sixth member with the couple's&nbsp;first child together in 2016. They named their youngest daughter&nbsp;Ella Roberts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sarah Loves Her Husband For Being An Amazing Father</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Sarah credits her husband for how exciting the blending of their two families has been over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On Father's Day, she posted&nbsp;on Instagram describing her immense love and admiration for<span> Toure.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>She Faced Many Challenges&nbsp;Before Touré</h2><p>Sarah surprised the world when she became a mother&nbsp;at the age of 14. The fact that she was so young, coupled with being a preacher's daughter, made it especially challenging for her to be accepted in society.</p><p>In addition to that, she also felt isolated at the time, and it took years for her to learn to handle the rumors and gossip about her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, she&nbsp;was earlier married to Robert Henson,&nbsp;the NFL player. Needless to say, it wasn't a very happy marriage as within four years of getting married, the couple made headlines about getting a divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she kept growing through these experiences and eventually met Touré Roberts. She decided to give love&nbsp;a second chance and is now living her dream&nbsp;life with her family.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>'Woman Evolve'</h2><p>Her latest New York Times Bestseller,&nbsp;Woman Evolve: Break Up with Your Fears and Revolutionize Your Life,&nbsp;is a resource that is aimed at helping women who are searching to find their full potential.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with ESSENCE</a>, Roberts explained,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Woman Evolve is really a command.
