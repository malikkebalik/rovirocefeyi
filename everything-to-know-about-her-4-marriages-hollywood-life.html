Sinead was heartbroken without her son, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeting</a> on July 17, 2023 that she’s never been the same since losing him. “Been living as undead night creature since. He was the love of my life, the lamp of my soul. We were one soul in two halves. He was the only person who ever loved me unconditionally. I am lost in the bardo without him,” she said. Sinead shared Shane with her ex, Irish folk singer&nbsp;<strong>Donal Lunny</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While the Grammy winner and Donal were never married, Sinead made it down the aisle four times during her life.

Just months before, she welcomed her first child into the world: a son named <strong>Jake Reynolds</strong>. He was the son of Sinead and her drummer, <strong>John Reynolds</strong>. They tied the knot in 1989, but within two years, their marriage was over. By then, Sinead had taken the world by storm with her sophomore album,&nbsp;I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>Although their romantic relationship ended, Sinead and John went on to collaborate on a number of albums, including Sinéad’s 2014 record. Their son made Sinéad a grandmother for the first time in 2015.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>Sadly, their relationship seemingly crumbled in 2016 when the musician shared a scathing letter addressed to both John and Jake on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook</a>. In th since-deleetd note, she accused them of ditching her when she was suicidal, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>. Reportedly addressing John, she wrote, “You tell that evil son of our (sic) that a person who suffers from two f****** medical conditions of which the symptoms include suicidal compulsion isn’t being manipulative if while he is being a f******g chauvinist bully like his grandfather they say they’re going to or feel like killing themselves.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>She also promised to take them to court for abandoning her, leaving her unwell and unable to work. “I will see you all in court. I want damages,” she reportedly threatened. “I have lost last year’s income and this year’s. I have had enormous medical expenses, and enormous trauma because of your torturing of me.”</p><h2>Sinead And <strong>Nick Sommerlad</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sinead and journalist<strong> Nick Sommerlad</strong> had a brief marriage circa 2001 to 2004. There is very little known about the union and they had no kids.</p><h2>Sinead And Steve Cooney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sinead-OConnor-Husband-embed-31.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sinead walked down the aisle once more with <strong>Steve Cooney</strong>, a longtime friend, in 2010. They were on tour together at the time. Sadly, by 2011, the marriage was over. “Steve is lovely so it’s not his fault but mine… it was an extremely happy marriage… I’m heartbroken about it breaking up,” the singer said at the time, according to the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Irish Examiner</a>. She revealed that comments about her weight gain became a problem in her marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>On the bright side, Sinead said she was happy to have her full closet space back. “When Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise split up, she said ‘at least now I can wear high heels again’. Well, now I have twice the wardrobe space so I’m just waiting for all those gifts to start coming in. Size 14 please,” she joked.</p><h2>Sinead And Barry Herridge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sinead-OConnor-Husband-embed-41.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Sinead and <strong>Barry Herridge</strong> met online after Sinead reportedly published a since-deleted ad for herself in The Irish Examiner, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>. In the column, she frankly wrote that she was in “desperate need of a very sweet sex-starved man.” She then listed the characteristics she was after, which included being over 43 years old and not being named Brian or&nbsp; Nigel. He also had to like sex, cuddling, and his mother.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sinead thought she met her perfect match in therapist <strong>Barry Herridge</strong>, and they wed at the end of 2011. Their marriage, however, was doomed from the start, and it <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>only lasted 16 days</a>. Taking to her blog in a since-deleted post, she claimed her marriage was “kyboshed by the behaviour of certain people in” her husband’s life just three hours after their ceremony, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.&nbsp; “And also by a bit of a wild ride I took us on looking for a bit of a smoke of weed for me wedding night as I don’t drink.” Her husband, apparently, was not thrilled at the prospect of her doing drugs,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sinead claimed she is the one who called off the marriage in order to set Barry “free”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sinead-OConnor-Husband-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2014, Sinead shocked the world when she claimed she and Barry were going to get married a second time. “My lovely king of a husband has asked if we would renew our marriage vows and not let outside forces such as were in the past,” the “Drink Before The War” singer wrote on her website, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mirror</a>.&nbsp;“So.. since no woman on earth could not adore a man that treats her like a goddess and loves her like a s*** : ).”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Barry has been my absolute harbour whenever seas were rough.. no matter what. and in the last two months when I was extremely ill because of kidney stones and various frights,” she further explained of their reunion.&nbsp;“We intend to have a renewal of our marriage vows at some point in the summer and this time with our families and friends present and a proper f*** off party.” They never walked down the aisle again.</p><h2>Who Else Was Sinead With?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Sinead was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of four</a>, and only her first child was a result of a marriage. She gave birth to her second kid, a daughter named <strong>Roison</strong>, in March 1995 with Irish journalist <strong>John Waters</strong>. She became a mom for the third time when she welcomed her son, Shane, with Irish folk singer&nbsp;<strong>Donal Lunny&nbsp;</strong>in 2004. Finally, Sinead welcomed her youngest child, &nbsp;son <strong>Yeshua</strong>, in 2006 with&nbsp;<strong>Frank Bonadio</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KipZ6ZlGK8pLvNp6arZZiqwKOtzZ1kbmlkZoRzf44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-twitch-star-loltyler1-net-worth-in-2022-meet-his-girlfriend-and-family-the-talks-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Twitch Star Loltyler1 Net Worth In 2022?
