And her life with her kid is more revelatory than one might expect. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Gilsig has learned a lot about life and how certain things about parenthood seem counter-intuitive at first hearing. Her life has been a different game altogether since she became a mother about 15 years ago. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Jessalyn Gilsig’s Daughter Changed Her Life and Values</h2><p>Gilsig <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed her daughter</a>, Penelope Salomon, on September 26, 2006. For the first four years of Penelope's life, she had both her parents living together. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Jessalyn Gilsig with her daughter, Penelope Salomon.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Photo: Jessalyn Gilsig/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, since their divorce, Penelope splits time between her parents. And while her arrival was certainly a life-changer for both of them, only Gilsig has talked about the changes in detail.</p><p>The first and obvious change was how Penelope immediately became her main focus. Gilsig, who was mostly busy with work before her arrival, is now <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">more thankful</a> for the free time she gets in-between projects and shoots as she gets to spend those with her little girl.</p><p>She was already raising her daughter in America, but she only went through becoming an American citizen in 2013. And raising her daughter in a foreign country&nbsp;(Gilsig is from Montreal, Quebec, Canada) made her reconsider her idea of nationality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"My daughter is American and I feel like wherever&nbsp;her&nbsp;home is, that’s my home," Gilsig told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brief Take</a> in June 2021. That thought had been the strongest when the mother-daughter duo was spending the lockdowns together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Penelope also made for a great daily motivator for the actress. Motherhood had made her "more brave, more focused, and more able to&nbsp;enjoy the&nbsp;moment."</p><p>"When I&nbsp;realized that I am a living example to another&nbsp;person, I think it made me more honest in myself," she confessed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glitter Magazine</a> in March 2021. She had also become more of a "live in the moment" kind of person, as she would confess in an earlier interview. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Another thing Penelope made her mother reconsider was her day-to-day&nbsp;priorities. While talking to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a> in October 2010, Gilsig provided an anecdote from her life about understanding what's more important at the moment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress recalled the time when her mother told her: "Remember on the plane, they say if the oxygen masks come down, put yours on first before your child."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>At first, she found that thought process going against the entire meaning of being a mother. "I said it would be impossible," she remembered.</p><p>However, after spending a bit of time thinking about it, she realized the true meaning behind the advice — "I realized she was saying the best way to serve your child is to make sure you’re healthy because they’re so dependent on you."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Gilsig understood that if she was not in her peak health, she could not take care of her daughter properly.</p><p>As for Penelope's life now, she is a high schooler — she started 10th grade in August 2021. She does not appear much on Gilsig's social media, but that might be by design.</p><h2>Jessalyn Gilsig’s Relationship with Ex Husband</h2><p>Gilsig met Salomon when she was just a high school-going girl. To her, he was a "cool guy" — he was the school football team's quarterback. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Later in life, he completely switched professions and became a film producer. After separating for a while, they started dating again in 2002 after he moved to Hollywood.</p><p>Three years later, the former couple married in a Jewish ceremony on January 1, 2005.</p><p>However, their marriage could only last for five years as they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce</a> on September 8, 2010, after separating in 2009. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Since then, Gilsig's dating life has made little news. There are no mentions of the <a href=# rel=follow>Vikings star</a> having a boyfriend or even playing the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVqMCiuNinZKChnKi2qHnDmqygoKSav2%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mabel-king.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mabel King</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./former-death-row-records-photographer-simone-green-to-release-time-served-on-death-row-book.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former Death Row Records Photographer Simone Green To Release &amp;quot;Time Served On Death Row&amp;quot; Book</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
