While at high school, Young enjoyed only the art classes. He practiced the guitar in his bedroom after school.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 id=h-angus-young-s-family-parents-and-siblings>Angus Young’s Family, Parents, and Siblings</h2><p>In the 1950s, <strong>Young’s father, William Young </strong>(1911–1985), <strong>his mother, Margaret</strong> (1913–1988; maiden name also Young), and his <strong>elder seven siblings</strong> lived at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow in Scotland. Cranhill was a tough, working-class suburb with high unemployment.</p><p>Prior to moving to Cranhill, William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine/saw operator in an asbestos/cement business. In 1940 William joined the Royal Air Force serving in World War II as a flight engine mechanic. After the war, William worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. Margaret was a housewife.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Young spent the first seven years of his life in Cranhill. His siblings were Stephen Crawford (1933–1989), Margaret (1935–2019), John (born 1938), Alexander (1938–1997), William (born 1940), George (1946–2017), and Malcolm (1953–2017).</p><p>Music was part of family life. Stephen played the piano accordion and the piano, Young’s sister Margaret was passionate about music, John played the guitar, and Alexander was an accomplished singer, bass guitarist, and saxophonist who in the early 1960s left for a career in music in Europe, and George and Malcolm eventually became founding members of the Easybeats and AC/DC respectively. Stephen was the father of Stevie Young who in later years took over from Malcolm in AC/DC.</p><p>Young himself took up the guitar at the age of five or six, receiving one lesson from Alexander, after which he was self-taught. Young also learned how to fight on Cranhill’s tough streets, and, on one occasion was struck by a car.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Prompted by the worst winter on record in Scotland and TV advertisements offering assisted travel for families to immigrate to Australia, the Youngs flew from Scotland to Sydney, Australia, in late June 1963. John migrated to Australia separately from his parents and siblings, while Alexander was the only child to remain in the UK.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, brother George met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda, a relationship that grew into their professional careers in music.</p><p>Young’s family moved into a semi-detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 id=h-angus-young-dating-wife-and-children>Angus Young Dating, Wife, and Children</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Young is <strong>married to a Dutch woman named Ellen van Lochem.</strong> They own homes in Australia, the UK, and the Netherlands.</p><h2 id=h-angus-young-salary>Angus Young Salary</h2><p><strong>Details about Young’s salary are not yet disclosed. </strong>However, information about how much he makes will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2 id=h-angus-young-net-worth>Angus Young Net Worth</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Angus’s net worth is estimated to be between $10 million and $50 million dollars</strong>.

The project released an album in Australia called Tales of Old Grand Daddy.</p><p>Prior to forming AC/DC, Angus Young played in a local group called Kantuckee. Kantuckee’s line-up included Bob McGlynn (vocals), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass), and Trevor James (drums). The band split and was later called Tantrum with the following lineup: Mark Sneddon (vocals-guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass), and Trevor James (drums).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Young was 18 when he and Malcolm formed AC/DC in 1973. Young was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar, and Dave Evans on vocals. The band had a recording contract with Albert Productions; it had also produced the work of the Easybeats.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>“Can I Sit Next To You Girl”, the band’s first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC, suggested by their sister Margaret, who saw the letters “AC/DC” on the back of her sewing machine.</p><p>Young tried a number of stage costumes, such as Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman named Super-Ang, before settling on his signature schoolboy look at the suggestion of his sister. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was created by his sister Margaret and when it fell apart from wear and tear, he used his uniform from Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney.</p><p>AC/DC released their debut album, High Voltage, exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975, along with a single “Baby, Please Don’t Go” / “Love Song”. Over the next three years AC/DC cemented themselves as a popular hard rock act, especially in Australia, with the follow-up albums T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock, and Powerage. All their albums until this point were produced by Young’s brother George in partnership with Harry Vanda. Their 1979 studio album, Highway to Hell, became their best-selling at the time and launched them to new heights of fame.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Months after this, Scott died from alcohol poisoning. Questions were raised as to whether the band could continue without him. Young and his other bandmates soon decided they should finish the work they had begun for their new album, so they recruited ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Five months later, Back in Black was released as a tribute to Scott.</p><p>It quickly became a huge success, far outselling any of their previous albums, going on to reach 22x multi-platinum in the US alone, selling 50 million copies, the second highest-selling album worldwide, behind only Michael Jackson’s Thriller. AC/DC’s next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, cemented their position as the most popular hard rock act of the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>AC/DC’s popularity declined with their next three albums, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall and Blow Up Your Video. AC/DC looked as though they had reached their peak early in the 1980s and by the end of the decade were in decline. Malcolm Young missed the majority of the band’s 1988 Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address his drinking problem. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence, he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young.</p><p>The band’s 1990 studio album, The Razors Edge, brought them back into the spotlight, reaching 5x multi-platinum in the US alone and selling between 10 and 12 million copies worldwide. Over the next 10 years, AC/DC released two other studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, which confirmed their renewed popularity and success.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>After a lengthy eight-year hiatus, AC/DC returned with a new studio album, Black Ice, in 2008. Black Ice debuted at number 1 in 29 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 14 of those, becoming one of their most successful albums worldwide, and was followed by a hugely successful world tour.</p><p>In 2010, AC/DC released an album of songs used for the Iron Man 2 soundtrack they had put together; this reached number one in many countries around the world, including the UK, and number four in the US. Malcolm Young confirmed in 2011 that AC/DC was working on a 16th studio album.</p><p>In April 2014 Malcolm was forced to leave the band due to ill health, leaving Young the sole continuous founding member left in the band. In May it was revealed that Stevie Young, Malcolm, and Young’s nephew, would stand in for his uncle to record AC/DC’s latest record.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>In September Malcolm officially retired and Stevie was made AC/DC’s official full-time rhythm guitarist. AC/DC released Rock or Bust in the fall of 2014. In March 2016, after the departure of both Malcolm Young and drummer Phil Rudd, AC/DC was set back with yet another departure; long-time lead singer Brian Johnson was ordered by doctors to stop performing or face total hearing loss.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Young, determined to finish what the band started, recruited Guns N’ Roses singer Axl Rose to stand in for Johnson for the remainder of the Rock or Bust World Tour. On 30 September 2020, the band’s official Twitter account announced the pending release of a new album, Power Up, with the lineup of Angus Young, Stevie Young, Brian Johnson, Cliff Williams, and Phil Rudd.</p><p>In 2003, AC/DC was inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame and the following year they were ranked number 72 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the “100 greatest artists of all time.” VH1 ranked them number 23 on their list of the “100 greatest artists of all time” and number 4 on their list of the “100 greatest artists of hard rock.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-angus-young><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About </span>Angus Young</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Angus?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Angus Young born Angus McKinnon Young is an Australian musician, best known as the co-founder, lead guitarist, songwriter, and only remaining original member of the hard rock band AC/DC.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><span id=How_old_is_XYZAll_Names>How old is <span id=_Contacts_H2>Young</span>?</span></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Angus McKinnon Young is 68 years old as of 2023.
