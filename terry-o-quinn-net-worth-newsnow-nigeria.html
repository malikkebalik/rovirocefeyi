Before starting his career in acting in the early 1980s, he worked as a bodyguard and boxer, among other jobs. Concerning his professional career, he changed his name to Terry O’Quinn in reference to his Irish origins, and not to be confused with another actor already called Terrance Quinn. He made his first film appearance in Michael Cimino’s film “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), but didn’t rise to fame until 1987 and 1989, after landing roles in the two hit films “The Stepfather 1” and “The Stepfather 2” in which he played a serial killer. For the above-mentioned role in the first film, the actor received nominations for Saturn and the Independent Spirit Awards. In 1994, he appeared as a guest star in the series “The Tales of the Crypt”, and straight afterwards he made three appearances in “The X-Files” (1995) series, each time playing a different role.</p><p>From 1996 to 1999, O’Quinn portrayed Peter Watts in the crime drama series “Millennium” created by Chris Carter, and meantime he also created characters in the series “JAG” (1995 – 2002). His net worth was rising steadily. In 2002, he began playing the recurring role of the FBI Assistant Director Kendall in “Alias” (2002 – 2004) before being invited by J.J. Abrams, the creator of the series, to play in “Lost” (2004 – 2010), in which he portrayed the character of John Locke, for which in 2005 he was nominated for an Emmy Award as the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and won this award in 2007. He is also the winner of a Saturn Award as the Best Supporting Actor on Television which he received for the same role. Then, he played Arthur Manchester in the series “Falling Skies” (2012 – 2013), for which the actor was nominated for another Saturn Award. Since 2015, he has been playing the role of Tom Tavner in the series “Patriot”, additionally, in 2016 Terry landed the main role in the series “Secret and Lies”.</p><p>All the above-mentioned roles have contributed to Terry O’Quinn’s net worth, which is estimated to be $18 million. In his personal life, he married Lori in 1979, and they have two sons but separated in 2010, and divorced shortly after.
