They secretly switch them with a store-bought brand, then panic when Aunt Bea decides to enter her pickles in the county fair. (Hey, it happens.)</p><p>Ross says that, when CBS decided to colorize “The Andy Griffith Show,” “The Christmas Story” episode — the only Christmas episode in the show’s eight-season history — was an obvious choice. “It hits all the right notes — family, the holidays, goodwill,” he says. “And what’s better than giving families the opportunity to watch something that’s pure, joyful and wonderful? Who doesn’t want to be in Mayberry?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/tv_andy2a.jpg><p>Choosing “The Pickle Story” was “a tough decision,” he says. But the original black-and-white master tape was in terrific condition, which made it easier. (Imperfections are more prevalent in a colorized product when the original isn’t pristine.)</p><p>“I also consulted with The Andy Griffith Show Fan Club [for ‘The Pickle Story.’] It’s clearly a top 10 fan favorite, and what would be cooler than showing those black-and-white pickles in green?” he says. “You get to see Barney in a red santa suit in one episode and green pickles in the other, so we’ve got red and green: the colors of Christmas.”</p><p>The colorization process takes six-to-eight weeks per episode. Ross and his team used color photography — and color home movies — shot on the set of “The Andy Griffith Show” in 1960 and ’61 to match colors to individual scenes from each original episode. From there, computer technology took over.</p><p>“We also had the advantage of three seasons of the ‘Griffith’ show airing in color, so we had a basis for knowing what our color selections were … The color of [Andy and Barney’s] uniforms, the colors of the walls in the sheriff’s office,” he says. “Obviously there a few things with colors — cars, street signs — that we didn’t know. Then it boiled down to making decisions that are hopefully tasteful.”</p><p>And Ross has a quick answer for those who oppose colorizing classic TV shows.</p><p>“Some people will never like it or accept it, and what we say … is that nobody is taking away the black-and-white versions,” he says.</p><p>“This is fun and is a fresh take.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnZ7kGtma21flrulxYyupbCqkaW9prCMoaawZZOXwG6vzqWmq6GqmrFus9GinZ%2BhpJ16tcKMnKOaq6OesLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joy-behar-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joy Behar Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./g%E1%BB%8Dvan%E1%BB%8D-kristi-noem-age-net-worth-di-bikini-na-foto-na-ekpo-%E1%BB%8Dk%E1%BB%A5-nwa-nwany%E1%BB%8B-%E1%BB%8Dr%E1%BB%A5-n.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gvan Kristi Noem | Age, Net Worth, Di, Bikini na Foto na-ekpo k, Nwa nwany, r n</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
