However, it is important to note that this claim is not real and is merely a prank. The post was shared by an NFL fan on Tuesday and has already garnered over 213,000 views. It includes a screenshot of a tweet that appears to be written by Dua Lipa, expressing interest in George Kittle.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Background_of_the_Viral_Post></span>Background of the Viral Post<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure id=attachment_23460 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-23460 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dua Lipa hit on married NFL star</figure><p>The Twitter user who shared the post expressed their loyalty to George Kittle and his wife Claire, stating that they would “die for Claire & George Kittle” and urging Dua Lipa to back off. While this prank fooled many social media users, it is important to clarify that Dua Lipa did not actually hit on the NFL star.</p><p>Similar pranks have occurred in the past, such as a viral tweet claiming that Taylor Swift was dating NFL star Quenton Nelson, which also turned out to be a hoax.
