While the trio make up the band, there is actually one more younger Jonas, and that’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Frankie</strong></a>. While he’s not a part of the band, it’s clear that he’s still incredibly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>close with the rest of his family.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Frankie celebrated his 23rd birthday on Thursday, September 28, and his brothers all penned tributes to him to celebrate his special day. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nick</a>, 31, shared a throwback photo of the two of them and wrote, “I love you very much” on his Instagram Story. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe</a>, 34, similarly posted an old pic and called his younger brother “one of the coolest people I know.” Kevin made a normal <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a> to wish a happy birthday to “the man, the myth, the legend.” Following Frankie’s birthday, here’s everything you need to know about him!</p><h2>Frankie Dropped His Debut EP in June</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>While he’s not in the band with his brothers, Frankie does have his own musical talent. He began his solo career back in February, releasing his debut single “Cocaine.” He performs under the name Franklin Jonas, and he released his debut 5-song EP&nbsp;Sewer Rat&nbsp;in June. The album is made up of alternative pop-rock, showing off his own musical tastes.</p><h2>He Worked With his Brothers A Lot Growing Up</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>As a kid, Frankie was more of an actor, while his brother’s band became international superstars. He made his voice-acting debut in the English version of the 2008 film&nbsp;Ponyo.&nbsp;As the Jonas Brothers began film and TV projects after their hit albums, Frankie made appearances alongside his brothers. He had small roles in&nbsp;Camp Rock 2&nbsp;and their Disney Channel series&nbsp;JONAS.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/who-is-frankie-jonas-brothers-embed.jpg><h2>He Co-Hosts ‘Claim to Fame’ with Kevin</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>All these years later, Frankie still gets to work with his older brothers on tons of exciting projects. Most notably, he co-hosts the reality series&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Claim to Fame</a>&nbsp;with Kevin. The show features contestants who are all related to a different celebrity living in a house, and they’re each trying to figure out what star each person is related to. The brothers finished the second season at the end of August!</p><h2>He’s Sober</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Frankie seems like he has a lot of fun with his many projects, he has been open about struggling with depression and substance use. He revealed having <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suicidal thoughts</a> in the past in a March 2021 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a>. “From a very young age, I struggled with drinking and drugging as an escape, ’cause I hated life, and I didn’t want to be here,” he said. “After many years of trying to kill myself accidentally, I came to a point where I was going to do it for real, and something intervened, and my life was saved.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He revealed that after that experience, he got sober, and it has helped him immensely. “I went to treatment, and it saved me. I couldn’t be more grateful for the fact that I’m alive today, because my world has changed so beautifully and astronomically,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/who-is-frankie-jonas-brothers-1-embed.jpg><h2>He’s a Student at Columbia University</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Frankie has been very open about his life on TikTok and seems excited to share his own music with the world, he has other interests, namely astrophysics. It was revealed that he was taking virtual classes on astrophysics (as well as academic writing) in a 2021 profile in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bustle</a>.&nbsp;“I’m getting the best grades I’ve ever gotten because it’s actual material that I’m interested in,” he told the outlet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kzs63NpKCeZZqku6K%2FjJqjpWWRl7y2wIytn55lqaTCr7PErKtmop%2BjrrR5waumraCVp3p2fZVxbmpvXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./babita-phogat-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Babita Phogat Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-baby-jacob-crouch-parents-gemma-barton-and-stepfather-craig-croch-found-guilty-of-bab.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Baby Jacob Crouch parents?
