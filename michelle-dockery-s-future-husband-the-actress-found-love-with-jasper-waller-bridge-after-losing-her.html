But despite the heartache of loss, Dockery gave love a chance again and is once more poised to walk down the aisle.</p><p class=dh>English Native Michelle Dockery drew her first breath in Barking, Essex, on December 15, 1981, born to Lorraine and Michael Dockery. She joined the entertainment industry as a stage actress in 2004, performing in the theatrical production "His Dark Materials."</p><p class=dh>In 2007, she played Eliza Doolittle in a revival of "Pygmalion," a role that earned her an Evening Standard Award nomination. By then, she had already debuted on screen, with brief parts in the TV shows "Fingersmith" and "Dalziel and Pascoe." She also appeared "Hogfather" and "Consent" in 2006 and 2007, respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ceb8eec20c76d81e590b44503d6c66df86514cd51e755cf7ad8830d4e24b9d3c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Michelle Dockery poses at the World Premiere of "Anatomy Of A Scandal" at the Curzon Mayfair on April 14, 2022, in London, England | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Dockery took on several projects in the following years before winning the role that would become her staple: Lady Mary Crowley in the romantic drama series, "Downton Abbey." Starring alongside <a class="me a" href=#>Maggie Smith</a>, she captivated audiences on the show between 2010 and 2015.</p><p class=dh>She was poised to walk down the aisle for the first time in 2015, but nearly a year later, Dockery was mourning the loss of her fiancé. Some time passed, and she opened herself up to love again. Last year, the private TV star, who has kept her fans on a need-to-know basis, announced her pending nuptials with Jasper Waller-Bridge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/045a4d4b2251d979d9fc82d244bb9c325c1964d353e7e103295219859779dfd6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Michelle Dockery and Jasper Waller-Bridge pose at the World Premiere of "Anatomy of a Scandal" at The Curzon Mayfair on April 14, 2022, in London, England | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Michelle Dockery Is Engaged, but She Is Tight-Lipped about Her Relationship with Her Fiancé</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Dockery and Waller-Bridge announced <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/downton-meets-fleabag-at-the-altar-michelle-dockery-to-marry-jasper-waller-bridge-38hhg7x9j>their engagement</a> in January 2022 <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/births-marriages-and-deaths-january-20-2022-qbvnfbjpk>via The Times</a>.
