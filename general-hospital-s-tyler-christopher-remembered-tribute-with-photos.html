Before getting on General Hospital, I would sometimes watch the show, and my favorite couple was Nikolas and Emily, so you can imagine how excited I was when we got paired up.

My character, Helena Cassadine, is lethal, evil, without compassion for anyone… except her grandson. She only makes a mistake when a decision concerns Nikolas, her Achilles’ heel. The joy of having Tyler as that grandson made the role so easy to play. He was the nicest, sweetest, most caring young man. It was tragic to watch him battle with his demons but so gratifying to see him winning the battle. I loved him and will miss him. One of my lasting memories of Tyler occurred on the set one day as we were about to shoot a scene. A little voice said, ‘Dad?’ Surprised, we stopped and realized it was his 6-year-old son whom he had brought to work with him that day. Tyler stepped forward not knowing what to expect and in the most gentle of voices asked, ‘What is it, son?’ ‘I just had to say I love you, Dad.’ Tyler hugged him and no one objected. His patient and loving way touched all of us… even the toughest of executives.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Genie Francis (Laura, General Hospital)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JPI_Episode13202_0001381197.jpeg><p>Christopher’s on-screen mom quoted Don McLean’s “Vincent (Starry Starry Night)” in paying her respects to her late co-star. “Sweet Tyler… ‘This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.’”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Natalia Livingston (ex-Emily, General Hospital)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/J029120_166110_4696_V3.jpg><p>“I want everyone to know how sweet and gentle Ty was. How gifted, how dedicated, how much he cared about his craft and those around him. I was honored to work with him for many years and admired his talent tremendously. He created such a safe space for us to work together. I felt confident when I worked with him. He made it easy. He was generous. He brought scenes to life with such grace and conviction. He gave his work everything he had. And, he was funny. So funny. I loved that about him. He made me laugh. He was one of the best chapters of my life, and I’ll always be grateful to him. I’m so happy we reconnected after over a decade apart. He was going to join my husband and I and our little ones for dinner at our home on a trip to Atlanta. That meant the world to me. He called me Naty… I called him Ty. The friendship was there. It was always there — through the ups and the downs. My heart goes out to his family and to his two precious children. Please, if you are struggling with alcohol abuse or a mental illness, don’t let this be your fate. I love you, Ty. I’ll never forget you. Thank you for the memories. Rest in peace, my friend.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Kyle Lowder (ex-Rex, Days of Our Lives)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-92978834.jpg><p>“Tyler was my former co-worker and my friend for over two decades.

A sweet-natured man. An Ohio boy like me. A man who had his demons — another thing we had in common. A young man I called son for the early part of our time together. Not this one!” began the post by the General Hospital alum, who played Stefan. “Tyler and I met when I visited his dressing room on the day he was about to camera test for the role of Nikolas Cassadine, my ‘son/nephew’ on General Hospital. We went over the scene a few times. He was very green and eager, and he had a kind of grace and a connection to the heart of the material that was special. I felt connected to him immediately. I can’t say enough about the beauty of Tyler Christopher’s work. He was an actor who was all instinct and spontaneity. It seemed effortless for him. I knew I wanted to work with him. I knew he would make me better. Our journey on General Hospital spanned around seven years. In the beginning, he asked for advice, and I offered Michael Chekov’s book, To the Actor, which had inspired me when I was starting out. Tyler gave so much to every scene. We connected in a deep way and lifted each other up. I know he was proud of the work he did even though he continued to look to me for approval. I reassured him that he was ‘there’ and to keep doing what he was doing. I called him ‘Baby Brando.’ He always laughed about that, but I wasn’t joking. I can only imagine how much more could have been. I know that over the years Tyler had addiction issues. I understood and told him so. We talked about it and checked in over the years but never really got deep into the subject of recovery. I regret that. When I asked how he was doing, he would generally say ‘good… fine.’ Some 20 years later, after several nominations, Tyler stood on that stage, with his Emmy in hand, and held up the book I had given him. I was thrilled for him and so touched and honored that he had mentioned our early connection. I had heard about Tyler’s troubles during his time on General Hospital. I checked in with him and he assured me he was fine. In 2017, a few months before he started on Days of Our Lives, Tyler called and asked if he could meet me for lunch. He flew in from the Midwest. He told me he had been having a hard time and he was now sober and working to stay that way. He said needed to take care of his kids and he needed a job. I advocated for him, and it took a while, but he finally came over to Days. As usual, Tyler was doing remarkable work, but I could tell that he was unsettled. Again, when I asked how he was doing, he said he was good. Looking back, I now know he wasn’t. My own family was affected by addiction and alcoholism. I have been fortunate to have survived all these years. I don’t take it for granted, and this great loss of this sweet man reminds me of how important it is to reach out to others who are suffering with these demons. I know how desperately Tyler loved his children and wanted to be with them and provide for them. When we met, they were all he could talk about. I hope that his children and family members, friends, those who are feeling this great loss will, with the passage of time, find peace. My heart aches, but all I wish for now, sweet Tyler, is that you are finally at peace. We won’t soon forget you.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Frank Valentini (Executive Producer, General Hospital)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JPI_071104SN_SNichols80778.jpeg><p>“I am heartbroken over the news of Tyler Christopher’s passing.

He was so kind and considerate. Generous beyond belief. Crazy funny. Unique, super smart and so talented. His greatest joy and proudest accomplishment were his children. He was 10 years older than me like my brother Derk (ex-Max), but he was like my second brother. Us three were as thick as thieves and the best of friends. We either lived with each other in California or we would move our families to be near one another. If one moved, we all moved sort of thing. We acted together, we traveled together. He and I loved Too Short and Common. Ninety-nine percent of the time that was what we played during our workouts. We worked out with one another, we partied, we laughed to no end and we made each other stronger. I remember visiting the General Hospital set before I was on the show. I was walking up to the studio doors, and Steve Burton (ex-Jason) and Tyler were just sitting on the stoop, sunning and chatting in between scenes. I remember thinking Ty just looked like a movie star. He was so cool to me. He looked out for me along with my brother Derk, especially when I first moved to L.A. He never stopped. The day we were moving back home to Michigan, he insisted he drive me to the U-Haul store because he knew we needed more boxes and supplies. We get there and he picks everything out, pays for it all and tells me it’s the ’least I can do, cuz.’ He hugged [my wife] Jenna, [daughter] Grace and I goodbye and proceeds to stuff enough cash in my hand to get us through our cross-country drive and then some. Demanded we take it. Told me to ‘get a protein shake on me.’ That was just his nature. He and Brienne wished us luck and said they’d be praying for us. We all cried that day like crazy. Because we were moving, sure, but on a deeper level, I think we all knew a shift was happening and nothing would ever be the same. I’m grateful to have those moments as sad as they were, though. It shows me what a powerful effect he had on me and so many of us. I will honor that effect and his memory going forward. I will miss him dearly. I pray for his kids and family. May God’s hand be ever present in their lives. I pray you are finally at peace, cousin.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Susan P.

If you’re a fan of his or even if you knew him personally, go on a walk with me. I first met Tyler when I was about 16. And as some of you may know, Nikolas and Robin had a very sweet friendship. But so did Kimberly and Tyler. We were a part of this acting class, which is where I met a lot of my really good friends, and we were also part of a friend group. Once when I was going through a breakup, it was a really hard time in my life. I was extremely lonely, and he apologized for not being there for me. And he said, ‘I hope you’ll forgive me.’ And it made me feel like I wasn’t crazy, that I was loved and that Tyler really was my friend. I mean, what 20-something-year-old TV star at the height of his career says the words, ‘I hope you’ll forgive me?’ But that’s the kind of friendship we had. Tyler was like a big brother to me. And things were never romantic between us, which was great. It made our friendship that much sweeter and simpler. The second thing I want to tell you is how Tyler always supported me when I wanted to make a transition into directing and how much that meant. It was like he could see it as clearly as I could. He would always say, ‘Yeah, go, go, go, go. Keep going, keep going. I know you’re gonna do it!’ He even went so far as to put me up in his house in Austin, Texas, while he was shooting a TV show. I was shadowing on an ABC Family show, and he totally took care of me while I was there. He would even make coffee in the morning before I went to work and leave me a little note, like, ‘See you at work.’ It was just thoughtful. The third thing I want to tell you is about how freaking funny this dude is. I remember Finola [Hughes, Anna] came up to me one day after working with him and she was like, ‘I didn’t know he was so funny. Tyler is so clever. He just says this stuff under his breath, and if you’re not listening very carefully, you’ll miss it.’ And I was like, ‘I know, I know! No one knows. He’s a freaking stand-up comedian in the body of a prince.’…&nbsp;He would tell these stories, and my stomach would hurt so bad. I would cry like those cartoons where the tears shoot out of the side of your eyes. So, I guess my point to all this is to tell you that even though Tyler had his own struggles, he found a way to be all of these things for me as a friend. He found a way to be empathetic, generous and had a way of just making me laugh like no one else could. We shared a love of hip-hop and robust sound systems in our cars. We shared a love of dogs and we shared a love of finding the emotional truth in our craft. And even though I’m super sad today, I’m so grateful that I got to know someone like that and grateful that I got to have a good friend for over 30 years. Rest in peace, man.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJmcobKzxY6tsKWdomKwqb7IrKuoqJiav26%2BxKacppqVp7KledOroJutpJp6sbTOraasZZeau6a%2BwKVkoaejpba1rcto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grown-ish-season-5-episode-15-is-here-check-out-junior-s-psychedelic-trip-short-clip.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grown-ish Season 5, Episode 15 is Here Check Out Juniors Psychedelic Trip Short Clip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./do-cole-and-jackie-end-up-together-in-my-life-with-the-walter-boys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Do Cole and Jackie End Up Together in My Life With the Walter Boys?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
