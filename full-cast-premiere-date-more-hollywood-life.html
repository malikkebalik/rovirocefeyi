Season 32 has a brand-new cast and a new co-host. With its latest batch of celebs, this season is going to be super-charging our fall TV viewing experience. However, the wait for season 32 might be extended amid the scabbing controversy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In a surprising move, ABC announced the first cast member all the way back in July 2023. During The Bachelorette season 20 finale, the second official cast member was revealed. Now we have the full cast to obsess over. Get those phones ready to vote! From a possible premiere date delay to the new DWTS pro, here are all the latest updates about season 32.</p><h2>Is Dancing with the Stars Still Returning Amid the Strikes?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Dancing with the Stars may delay the season 32 premiere date in the wake of striking writers picketing the show’s rehearsals, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. ABC has not made an official announcement yet regarding a premiere date push.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Veep star <strong>Matt Walsh</strong> revealed in a statement that he would be pausing his involvement with the show “until an agreement is made with the [Writers Guild of America]. I was excited to join the show and did so under the impression that it was not a WGA show and fell under a different agreement. This morning when I was informed by my union, the WGA, that it is considered struck work I walked out of my rehearsal. I have been and will always stand with my union members of the WGA, SAG and DGA.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Initially, Dancing with the Stars was moving forward with the original September 26 premiere date. According to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, the show was going to be working “in compliance” with the SAG-AFTRA rules, and a “key focus” was going to not “put talent in a tough spot.” DWTS employs a crew of 500 people and has one WGA writer on stage. The sole WGA writer is expected to be re-hired as soon as the strike ends.</p><h2>Dancing with the Stars Season 32 Premiere Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Dancing With the Stars season 32 will premiere on Tuesday, September 26. The episode will be an expanded premiere that will air from 8 p.m. to 10:31 p.m. ET. The show is moving away from its typical Monday night timeslot and will shift to Tuesdays this fall.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>On August 21, ABC released the key art for season 32 and an exciting promo featuring co-hosts <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alfonso Ribeiro.</strong></a> Julianne and Alfonso danced together in the teaser and showed they will be one formidable co-hosting team. “It’s a new spin on Dancing with the Stars!” the video’s caption read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Given the ongoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writers’ strike</a>, ABC has assembled a fall lineup that consists of all unscripted shows. Dancing With the Stars season 32 is a staple of their lineup, along with Bachelor In Paradise, The Golden Bachelor, and more.</p><h2>Dancing With The Stars Season 32 Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>full cast for Dancing With the Stars season 32</a> was revealed on Good Morning America on Sept. 13.
