After five, 10 minutes he has a map in his eyes, in his brain, to know exactly where is the space and what is the panorama.”</p><p>Ernesto Valverde, another former <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Barcelona</a> manager, agrees that Messi starts each match on a one-man reconnaissance foot patrol. “As the game advances, he gets in little by little,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">told the Financial Times</a>. “But he knows perfectly where the rivals’ weaknesses are.”</p><p>Even a casual fan knows that Messi strolls around the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>World Cup</a> like it’s the planet’s most popular Ramblers meet-up.

It rarely works.</p><p>“Very calmly and nicely he came up to me and asked, ‘Are you really going to follow me all game?’” the Honduras midfielder Hector Castellanos recalled after man-marking Messi in a September friendly. “I told him, ‘Honestly, yes, crack’. He smiled and didn’t say anything else.” Messi scored twice, set up a third goal and gave Castellanos his shirt after the game.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17162930/castellanos-messi-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Messi shielding the ball from Castellanos (Photo: Eric Espada/Getty Images)</span><p>Against a more conventional defensive scheme, where players organise themselves in lines and close down attackers who are threatening to receive the ball in their zone, Messi’s job isn’t to lose any one guy but to figure out where to stand so that nobody’s sure who’s responsible for him.

He had barely even broken into a jog. But by taking two steps to his right near the centre circle a full 11 seconds before the shot, he helped create the whole attack.</p><p>“Just by moving two paces,” Guardiola wrote in his 2001 autobiography La Meva Gent, El Meu Futbol (My People, My Football), “I could radically change the game’s rhythm.”</p><h2><b>Taking space, making space</b></h2><p>To help avoid those little moments of confusion, a lot of defences will give their left centre-back a clear mandate to step out to stop Messi from receiving between the lines. You may remember Croatia’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Josko Gvardiol</a> spending the semi-final draped all over Messi like a chequered scarf. When one dropped off the back line, the other did too.</p><p>But Messi can use that kind of attention to his advantage, too. Half an hour into the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Croatia</a> game, when Argentina midfielder <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Enzo Fernandez</a> turned on the ball between the lines, his most obvious option was <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Julian Alvarez</a> making a run right up the middle. Normally both Croatian centre-backs would work together to step forward and try to catch that run offside or sprint back to goal and cut it off.</p><p>But Gvardiol, hyper-conscious of Messi, checked his shoulder and paused for a split-second as Messi curled into midfield toward the ball. Gvardiol’s moment of hesitation meant that while his retreating centre-back partner played the runner onside, he left a gaping space for Alvarez to run into.</p><p><img width=2098 height=1178 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17150822/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-2.03.52-PM.png alt sizes="(max-width: 2098px) 100vw, 2098px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Penalty, Argentina. Goal, Messi.</p><p>Again, Messi had helped set up a dangerous attack without touching the ball, almost without even moving. Taking a step to his left instead of running toward goal let him occupy potentially valuable space in midfield where he could receive and dribble at the defence. But when Gvardiol slowed up to defend that space, it created even more dangerous space in behind for Alvarez.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The rise of off-ball tracking data in football has started to make it possible to measure how Messi’s walking helps his team. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paper presented at the 2018 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference</a> calculated the value, in goal probability, of the spaces that Barcelona players occupied for themselves or generated for their team-mates in one <a class=ath_autolink href=#>La Liga</a> game.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Messi was an outlier for how much of his space gain was “passive” — as in walking or jogging, not running. Yet he still managed to occupy more valuable spaces than almost any other Barcelona player while generating some of the most valuable spaces for his team-mates.</p><p><img width=3438 height=976 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17151031/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-9.44.17-AM.png alt sizes="(max-width: 3438px) 100vw, 3438px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As FiveThirtyEight summed up the research, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Messi walks better than most players run</a>.</p><h2><b>Personal magnetism</b></h2><p>Not all of Messi’s space creation is entirely touch-free. When defenders try to get tight to <a href=#>keep him from facing goal on his stronger left foot</a>, Messi likes to dribble backward or exchange simple passes to draw his marker farther and farther out of the back line. It’s the same idea as a lot of his off-ball walking, but now he’s using the ball as bait.</p><p>This was another way Gvardiol tended to get caught in Messi’s gravitational pull. In the example below, Messi receives the ball between the lines but can’t turn with Gvardiol pressuring him from behind. So he dribbles toward the halfway line, dragging the centre-back with him.</p><p><img width=2096 height=1176 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17152018/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-10.15.13-AM.png alt sizes="(max-width: 2096px) 100vw, 2096px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img width=2100 height=1176 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17151911/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-10.15.48-AM.png alt sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A few seconds later, Messi —&nbsp;who simply walked backward, laid the ball off and stood still waiting for it to return to him —&nbsp;is dribbling at the defence while Alvarez makes a run into the gap behind Gvardiol, who’s caught in no-man’s land.</p><p><img width=2098 height=1176 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/12/17151944/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-10.16.21-AM.png alt sizes="(max-width: 2098px) 100vw, 2098px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On that play, Messi didn’t wind up spotting the killer pass.
