He’s a toolsy player who had a promising season when healthy. Their next two picks in Etienne Morin and Aydar Suniev aren’t sure things, but they’re quality prospects with legit shots to play games.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3>Draft Class</h3><p><strong>16. Samuel Honzek, LW, VANCOUVER (WHL)</strong></p><p>November 12, 2004 | 6′ 3″ | 195 pounds</p><p>Tier: Bubble top and middle of the lineup player</p><p>Skating: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NHL</a> average<br>Puck skills: NHL average<br>Hockey sense: NHL average<br>Compete: Above NHL average<br>Shot: Above NHL average</p><p><strong>Player comparable:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pavel Zacha</a></p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Honzek was an all-situations winger for Vancouver. A leg cut suffered at the world juniors kept him out for several months. Honzek played for Slovakia in the summer 2022 world juniors. He got an invite to their senior team camp in the spring of 2022. He was a part of the Hlinka Gretzky team that won silver.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Honzek’s game is exciting from a pro-projection standpoint. He’s a big forward who can skate well, which when combined with the offense he’s showing makes for a well-rounded player. I don’t think he’s amazing with the puck, but he has good hands, can make tough plays with pace and can finish chances both from range and in tight. In the WHL he ran the power play from the flank but that likely won’t be his role as a pro. Off the puck he shows good details and a strong work rate. He wins a lot of battles and can kill penalties. Honzek dabbled at center for a couple of WHL games but is likely a winger as a pro. Even as a wing he projects to be an important two-way player for an NHL team.</p><p><strong>Thoughts on the pick:</strong> Samuel Honzek brings some much needed size to the Calgary system. But he’s not just a big guy. He can skate, he has legit offense, his offense is comparable among big guys to a lot of top 10 overall picks recently out of the CHL, and he can play both ways. Whether he’s a center or not will be an interesting debate going forward, but he projects as a top six forward no matter the position in Calgary.</p><p><strong>48. Etienne Morin, LHD, MONCTON (QMJHL)</strong></p><p>March 9, 2005 | 6′ 0″ | 180 pounds</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Tier: Projected to play NHL games</p><p>Skating: NHL average<br>Puck skills: NHL average<br>Hockey sense: NHL average<br>Compete: NHL average<br>Shot: High-end</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Morin had a successful second QMJHL season putting up significant offensive totals, especially for a defenseman. He then posted 17 points in 12 playoff games. Morin was injured during the summer so he couldn’t play for Team Canada, but joined the U18 in the spring where his play was average. He was the 21st pick in his QMJHL Draft.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> With the puck on his stick, Morin has a lot of confidence and creativity. He has strong stick skills to beat checkers one-on-one. He can make plays and has the poise to hold onto pucks for an extra second. He has a great wrist and slap shot and is a goal-scoring threat from range. I wouldn’t call his speed a major asset, but it’s good enough to go with excellent edges and elusiveness in his skating. His skating stride can look awkward and I had lower grades on it for large portions of the season, but I think there’s enough power and explosiveness in his edgework to play in the NHL. Morin works hard enough but whether he can defend NHL speed and size will be a minor question. I like a lot about his game though, and can see him playing in the NHL in an offensively-tilted role even if he may need to be sheltered.</p><p><strong>80. Aydar Suniev, LW, PENTICTON (BCHL)</strong></p><p>November 16, 2004 | 6′ 2″ | 192 pounds</p><p>Tier: Projected to play NHL games</p><p>Skating: Below NHL average<br>Puck skills: NHL average<br>Hockey sense: NHL average<br>Compete: NHL average<br>Shot: Above NHL average</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Suniev played a large role on the Penticton Vees the last season and a half as they dominated the BCHL. He was in Russia and came up with the CSKA program but has played most of his high-level amateur hockey in North America — first in the U.S., then in Canada. He is committed to the University of Massachusetts.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Suniev has a highly intriguing toolkit as a 6-foot-2 winger with legit skill and scoring ability. He has a quick stick and can make difficult plays in small areas. He is a threat as a passer and goal scorer who can make a lot happen in the offensive zone and on a power play. Suniev’s skating is fine, but lacks a true separation gear for the higher levels. He’s not much of an asset off the puck, but he’s consistent enough in his effort to be a useful pro. Suniev could be an NHL player in the bottom half of a lineup</p><p><strong>112. Jaden Lipinski, C, VANCOUVER (WHL)</strong></p><p>December 2, 2004 | 6′ 4″ | 210 pounds</p><p>Tier: Has a chance to play games</p><p>Skating: Poor<br>Puck skills: NHL average<br>Hockey sense: Below NHL average<br>Compete: NHL average</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Lipinski was an undrafted player in the WHL, but the Phoenix Jr. Coyotes product has risen quickly as a pro prospect after being a top player for the Vancouver Giants this season.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Lipinski’s size/skill combination is what makes him interesting as a potential pro. When you see him come up the ice and beat a defender one-on-one or make a tough small-area play you can envision him creating offense versus men. I like his work ethic enough, he can kill penalties and he can play the middle well. With Lipinski his feet will be an issue. I’ve seen slower big guys, but his first few steps aren’t great and the NHL pace will be a problem for him. While he has offense, I’m not sold yet he’s a true play driver and can create a lot for others.</p><p><strong>176. Yegor Yegorov, G, DYNAMO MOSCOW JR. (RUSSIA-JR.)</strong></p><p>August 30, 2005 | 6′ 3″ | 183 pounds</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Yegorov is a 6-foot-3 goalie who played 15 games for Dynamo Moscow’s junior team and recorded a .915 SV%.</p><p><strong>208. Axel Hurtig, LHD, ROGLE JR. (SWEDEN-JR.)</strong></p><p>June 10, 2005 | 6′ 4″ | 202 pounds</p><p>Tier: Has a chance to play games</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Skating: Poor<br>Puck skills: Below NHL average<br>Hockey sense: NHL average<br>Compete: Above NHL average</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Hurtig was a regular defenseman on Rogle’s J20 team and was an important piece of their title run. He steadily got more responsibility with Sweden’s U18 team this season and following a key injury stepped up into a major minutes role in their silver medal at the U18 Worlds.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> He’s a big defenseman with good physicality in his game and someone who is solid in his own end because of his reach and hardness. The pure offensive talent in his game doesn’t excite you, though. He can make a fine first pass and I think he would have had more points on a lesser J20 team but offense won’t be his calling card as a pro. His skating is OK at best, too. There are questions on the pro projection, similar to someone like Adam Ginning at the same age, but the way he plays gives him a chance to make it.</p><p>(Photo of Samuel Honzek and Gary Bettman: Christopher Hanewinckel / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k29qcWhiaHxzfJFsZmluX2eFcK%2FApZ6aqqlis62tzJ6qZqaYoXqlvsCfq2ZqYGeAbrPRmpueq12ltqS30maYp5mcrsCqv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./england-world-cup-2022-starting-xi-and-golden-boot-odds-harry-maguire-odds-on-for-iran-harry-kane.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>England World Cup 2022 starting XI and Golden Boot odds: Harry Maguire odds-on for Iran, Harry Kane</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bol-bol-age-parents-and-ethcnicity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bol Bol | Age, Parents And Ethcnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
