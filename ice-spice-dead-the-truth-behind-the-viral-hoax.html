She is alive and well, and has simply fallen victim to a death hoax, which are sadly all too common on social media.</p><p>The rumor that Ice Spice is dead started circulating on TikTok in early March 2023, when a user posted a video claiming that she had been shot and killed in New York. The video quickly went viral, with thousands of users expressing their shock and grief over the alleged news. Some even posted tribute videos and messages for the rapper, using the hashtag #RIPIceSpice.</p><p>However, the video was soon exposed as a hoax, as there was no evidence or confirmation of Ice Spice’s death from any credible source.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ice Spice’s Response</h2><p>Ice Spice herself addressed the death hoax on her Instagram story, where she posted a screenshot of the video and wrote: “Y’all really need to chill with these fake rumors. I’m not dead, I’m just working on my album. Stop playing with my life like that.”</p><p>She also thanked her fans for their support and love, and assured them that she was doing fine. She said: “I appreciate all the love and concern, but I’m good. I’m just busy making hits for y’all. Don’t believe everything you see on the internet. Love you guys.”</p><p>Ice Spice also joked about the situation on Twitter, where she tweeted: “Ice Spice dead? Nah, I’m just in ha mood.” She then added: “But seriously, stop with the death hoaxes. It’s not funny. It’s disrespectful to me and my family. And it’s hurtful to my fans who care about me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ice Spice’s Career</h2><p>Ice Spice, whose real name is Isis Naija Gaston, was born and raised in the Bronx, New York. She is the oldest of five siblings, and her father was once an underground rapper who inspired her to pursue music. She started writing poetry and freestyle raps from a young age, and began her musical career in 2021, after meeting producer RiotUSA.</p><p>Ice Spice first gained major recognition in late 2022, with her song “Munch (Feelin’ U)”, which achieved viral popularity on TikTok. The song, which samples the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, showcases Ice Spice’s relaxed and playful rapping style, and has been praised for its catchy and humorous lyrics.</p><p>After signing with 10K Projects in a joint venture with Capitol Records, she released the follow-up singles “Bikini Bottom” and “In Ha Mood” in promotion for her debut extended play (EP), Like…? (2023). The EP contained the Billboard Hot 100-charting song “Gangsta Boo” (featuring Lil Tjay), spawned the single “Princess Diana” (with Nicki Minaj), and contained the single “Deli” on its deluxe edition.</p><p>She saw further mainstream success with her collaborative singles that same year; “Boy’s a Liar Pt. 2” (with PinkPantheress), “Karma” (with Taylor Swift), and “Barbie World” (with Nicki Minaj and Aqua) each peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, making Ice Spice the first rapper to release four songs which did so that year. Her 2024 single, “Think U the Shit (Fart)” is preceding the release of her forthcoming debut studio album, Y2K!.</p><p>Music journalists have noted Ice Spice’s unique and innovative approach to rap music, which blends elements of hip hop, drill, pop, and R&B. She has also been praised for her witty and confident personality, and her ability to connect with her fans through social media. She has been honored with the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, the People’s Choice Award for “New Artist of the Year” and the Impact Award from the BMI R&B/Hip-Hop Awards, as well as nominations for four Grammy Awards including Best New Artist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Ice Spice is not dead, and the rumor that she is was nothing but a cruel and unfounded hoax. The rapper is alive and well, and is busy working on her music and entertaining her fans. She is one of the most talented and successful artists of her generation, and has a bright future ahead of her. Ice Spice is here to stay, and no one can stop her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnrCmedKpoJydXZmyorCMrZ%2BeZaSnwrW0jJucoaGemXq1tMRmraKqkaF6qbvAsWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ireland-baldwin-bio-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ireland Baldwin Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-cook-beef-liver-a-step-by-step-guide.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How To Cook Beef Liver: A Step-By-Step Guide</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
