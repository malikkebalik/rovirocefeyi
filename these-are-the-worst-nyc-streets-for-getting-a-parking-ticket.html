That’s Kips Bay, where nearly 13 tickets are issued per every 100 parking spots, SpotAngels found, pulling in over $1.3 million.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Certain neighborhoods across NYC are prone to parking tickets, new research finds. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Overall, Midtown brought in the most penalty revenue at $13,338,865 from 158,032 tickets. (The study notes there are 2,546,491 parking spots with restrictions there.)</p><p>Laurelton and Ozone Park were found to be the worst places to park in Queens, with each averaging 13 tickets per 100 spaces. The worst place in The Bronx was Pelham Bay Park, with nine tickets per 100 spots, although Fordham had the most ticket revenue at $1.4 million.</p><p>Staten Island was not included in the study.</p><p>In addition to the worst neighborhoods, the study also identified 10 specific spots where drivers were likely to get slapped with fines, many of which are in the Midtown hot zone. Check them out below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>152-11 89th Ave., Jamaica, Queens</h2><p>The most ticketed space in all of New York City is in front of an apartment complex called Parkhill City in eastern Queens.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jamaica is one of the highest ticketed neighborhoods in Queens. <span class=credit>Angel Chevrestt</span></figure><p>The spot saw 568 tickets over the 11-month study and sits near Jamaica’s major train junction of an LIRR station, the AirTrain to JFK Airport and Sutphin Boulevard subway station, which services the E, J and Z lines.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>229 W. 43rd St., Manhattan</h2><p>Right on the edge of Times Square between Seventh and Eighth avenues, this spot in front of the original New York Times building brought in 409 tickets during the last year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The theater district was found to have some of the most ticketed parking spaces within all of NYC. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Ironically, the location is <a href=#>perched between two public parking garages</a>. It’s also close to several theaters, plus Times Square tourist attractions like Dave & Buster’s along with the Hard Rock Cafe, Carmine’s 44th Street location and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. (Maybe Forrest was onto something with all that running.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>114 W. 47th St., Manhattan</h2><p>Try not to blame The Post for this one. Sitting right across from the News Corp Building on the Avenue of the Americas, 394 tickets were given out at this location.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The streets near Radio City Music Hall also have some of the most ticketed spaces in all of the city. <span class=credit>dpa/picture alliance via Getty I</span></figure><p>Along this stretch, which is also the hub for Fox News, was the former site of the NHL store before it moved to Hudson Yards. The space is also across the street from Manhattan’s Diamond District and is a short walk to Radio City Music Hall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2 W. 45th St., Manhattan</h2><p>The bustling corner of 45th Street and Fifth Avenue is home to this space which had 371 tickets issued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The city banked millions of dollars in parking tickets from several NYC nabes, especially in Midtown, a new study finds. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Only a quick trip to the nearby NBA store, this location is also not far from the happening areas of Times Square and Bryant Park.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>500 and 554 W. 30th Street, Manhattan</h2><p>We head to Hudson Yards for the next two entries on this list. Both of these vessels of parking tickets lie near one another, in between 10th and 11th avenues at the mega development. 500 W. 30th St. had 361 tickets and 554 was just a tad behind with 359, bringing the total to an expensive 720.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hudson Yards has not one, but two of the city’s worst parking spaces. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The High Line</a> elevated walkway is nearby, as are entrances to the extensive shops and restaurants at the yards. There’s also a parking garage — for those unwilling to risk it —&nbsp;within striking distance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>333 Seventh Ave., Manhattan</h2><p>Turns out good style can’t get you out of a parking ticket. A spot right across from the Fashion Institute of Technology, between 28th and 29th streets, yielded 355 tickets to frustrated drivers.</p><p>Another likely factor is that Madison Square Garden is a short, three-block walk north.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One of the worst spots was found to be across from FIT in the center of Manhattan. <span class=credit>STEPHEN YANG</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5 E. 47th St., Manhattan</h2><p>You’d have better luck parking at the Top of the Rock. The zone right outside Rockefeller Center between Fifth and Madison avenues was responsible for 344 freshly minted tickets.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rockefeller Center may be a beautiful sight, and the parking enforcement officers are on top of their game. <span class=credit>Universal Images Group via Getty</span></figure><p>Along with being adjacent to the famed plaza, this space is also a few short blocks south of St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the many designer stores along Fifth Avenue.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>135 West 50th St., Manhattan</h2><p>There were 339 tickets dealt at this spot between Sixth and Seventh avenues — one which is also very close to a public garage.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Times Square area was a major hot spot for parking tickets in the past year. <span class=credit>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Attractions such as Radio City Music Hall, Times Square and Rockefeller Center are only a hop, skip and a jump away by foot, making this a potentially very costly day for hapless drivers who don’t read the signs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>37-27 74th St., Queens</h2><p>The final spot on this list takes us back to the world’s borough! This busy Jackson Heights street saw 335 tickets during the study’s period.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jackson Heights is home to the 10th worst parking space in NYC, new research finds. <span class=credit>Zandy Mangold</span></figure><p>Just off Broadway and in the shadow of the BQE, this location is close to a small public parking lot and sits near a large transit junction and extensive retail corridor. It’s also closet to the public transit hub of the E, F, M, R and 7 trains —&nbsp;food for thought for anyone who wants to check out the area’s lively scene while avoiding unanticipated fines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpmanBfqbWmv8RmmKudXam1pnnWqKmsrF2jxqR50q2pnp2kqHqnu9Fmnp6spJ67qHnAZqeaqpueu6h506KapJ2kZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wes-malott.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wes Malott</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theo-galan-jr.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Theo Galan Jr.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
