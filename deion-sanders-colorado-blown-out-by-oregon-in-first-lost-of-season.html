They’re fighting for clicks, we’re fighting for wins. There’s a difference,” Lanning told his team in front of ESPN’s cameras.</p><p>Troy Franklin caught eight passes for 126 yards and two scores for Oregon.</p><p>After the game, Lanning was more reserved.</p><p>“I think that team’s heading in the right direction. I think that coach is doing a phenomenal job,” Lanning said. “I get a little passionate at times. I need to humble myself a little bit. This is one game.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Oregon running back Bucky Irving, left, dodges a tackle by Colorado’s Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig, center, and LaVonta Bentley, right, during its 42-6 win over Colorado. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Sanders turned around a Colorado program that won just one game last year, bringing aboard 67 new scholarship players and opening the season with wins over TCU, Nebraska and last weekend’s double-overtime thriller against Colorado State.</p><p>It doesn’t get any easier next Saturday as Colorado will be hosting USC.</p><p>He got a nice welcome to Autzen Stadium before the game from Nike co-founder Phil Knight, the patriarch of Oregon sports.

He also ran for an 11-yard TD. One fan held a sign that said: “This is Nix Country.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Colorado head coach Deion Sanders talks with his son and quarterback Shedeur Sanders during the first half. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Coach Prime’s son Shedeur Sanders went into Saturday averaging 417.0 passing yards per game, with 10 touchdowns against one interception. He completed 23 of 33 passes for 159 yards and a late touchdown against the Ducks.</p><p>He was sacked seven times.</p><p>Oregon fans chanted “Overrated!” in the final moments.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s a target on our back,” Coach Sanders said.</p><p>He also bristled at the notion that the Buffaloes needed a dose of reality amid all the hype.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bo Nix runs for a touchdown during Oregon’s blowout win. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“People around the country would say, ‘This is what they needed to humble themselves.’ We weren’t arrogant or whatever, we’re confident people,” he said. “If our confidence offends your insecurity, that’s a problem with you, it’s not us.”</p><p>Oregon, which visits Stanford on Saturday, scored touchdowns on its first three possessions, two on Nix’s passes.</p><p>Nix was intercepted for the first time this season in the second quarter. It was also Oregon’s first turnover of the year. But the Ducks’ defense sacked Shedeur Sanders on third down, pushing him back 16 years, and Colorado again was forced to punt.</p><p>Franklin was wide open running into the endzone for a 36-yard touchdown from Nix, and Nix ran for another TD to cap the first half onslaught.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Deion Sanders exits the field after Colorado’s blowout loss to Oregon. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>It was Colorado’s first game without two-way standout Travis Hunter, who was sent to the hospital with a lacerated liver from a late hit in the game last weekend against Colorado State.</p><p>Hunter had nine tackles, two pass breakups and an interception and also had 16 catches for 213 yards on offense.</p><p>“Travis is always going to be missed. He’s the best darn football player in college football,” Sanders said. “It’s just like you writing an article and your pen is missing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2tfmbKqu81mqpqmlJq%2FtHnCqKOoqpGZvG6uy6iup2WfqsFurthmpqudl6S7brXNZp2iqqOpeq270q1kqJ5dqLKiv86nZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./forbidden-fruit-a-flavor-has-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Forbidden Fruit a flavor has Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-iowa-state-wr-jaylin-noel-wikipedia-biography-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Iowa State WR Jaylin Noel ?
