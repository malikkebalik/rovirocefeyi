Born to Latin American parents in Brooklyn, Teofimo admits he has been subjected to racial injustice since childhood.</strong></p><p>On February 12, 2021, Lopez took to his Instagram handle to support victims of racial injustice.</p><p>In the same post, Lopez issued a message for the Asian communities, telling them to stand against rising Anti-Asian hatred in recent years.</p><p>Teofimo started training in boxing at a young age. In 2016, he made it to the Summer Olympics in Rio, representing Honduras.</p><p>Eventually, the French lightweight boxer Sofiane Oumiha knocked him out of the competition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-American-Boxer-Teofimo-Lopez-In-2020-e1686476106590.jpg><p>Teofimo started his professional career after his return from the unsuccessful Summer Olympics campaign in 2016.</p><p>He signed with the boxing promotional company Top Rank in October and immediately debuted in November.</p><p>After a perfect 10-0 record, he announced he was ready for the world stage in December 2018. He is currently the WBO and The Ring magazine lightweight world champion.&nbsp;</p><h2>Parents, Teófimo And Jenny López</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Teofimo Lopez</a> was born on July 30, 1997, to his parents, Teófimo and Jenny López, in Brooklyn, New York. Originally from Spain, his family migrated to Honduras after the Second World War.</p><p>Although many of his family members still live in Honduras, his grandmother, like many Hondurans, emigrated to the United States with her children when his dad Teófimo Sr. was five.</p><p>They had moved to the States for better lives. But Teófimo Sr.’s childhood was tough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Little-Teofimo-Lopez-With-His-Dad-Teofimo-Jr-e1686481396698.jpg><p>Not only had they had difficulty paying school fees, their mother had to do many jobs to provide them with food and other basic needs. But that was insufficient.</p><p>As a result, Teofimo Sr. did not even finish high school.</p><p>To make it worse, young Teófimo Sr. became addicted to drugs at a young age, and he continued doing it even after his marriage to Teofimo Lopez’s mom.</p><p>Luckily, she had a bartending job at a strip club, which somehow assisted them financially.</p><p>His mother, Jenny López, had a no different life from his dad while growing up. She was raised in a poor household in New York and did not go to college either.</p><p>Teofimo Lopez’s birth gave his family a way out. Since his dad was a <a href=#>boxing</a> enthusiast, he began teaching boxing to his young son when he was six.</p><p>Since Teofimo is a successful boxer, Jenny and Teófimo Sr.’s life has completely changed.</p><p>Teófimo Sr. is still active as his son’s boxing coach. They have not revealed if they have any other children aside from Teofimo Lopez.</p><h2>Will Teofimo Lopez Retire Anytime Soon?</h2><p>With continued success since his professional debut, it is ridiculous to discuss Teofimo Lopez’s retirement now. In his mid-twenties, Teofimo has lost only one fight and still has many battles to conquer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Josh-Taylor-Recently-Lost-His-Titles-To-Teofimo-Lopez-e1686481643640.jpg><p>He recently won a fight against the Scottish Josh Taylor at Hulu Theatre on June 10 in New York City.</p><p>Taylor had previously announced he would defend his WBO and The Ring light welterweight belts against Lopez in April 2023.</p><p>Following the match, Teofimo expressed joy, saying, “It’s been a long time coming. We just beat the No. 1 ranked guy, the No. 1 champion, former undisputed champion.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAxKidoqWfYrmwvMSzZKmZopq7tb%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiffany-del-real-is-happily-married-to-her-husband-after-the-unfortunate-past.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiffany Del Real Is Happily Married To Her Husband After The Unfortunate Past</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-sokolovic-s-relationship-affairs-net-worth-earnings-movies-parents-family-height-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Sokolovic's Relationship, Affairs, Net Worth, Earnings, Movies, Parents, Family, Height, facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
