He was also not allowed to visit his children as per the order, reports the Daily Mail.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Cops find family of 5 dead at Buffalo Grove home during wellness check in apparent murder-suicide</a></p><p><a href=#>Who are the Buffalo Grove victims? Autopsy reveals Illinois family of 5 died from ‘sharp force injuries’</a></p><p>Last September, his wife Vera Kisliak sought a protective order after he threatened to kill and dismember her, kept loud music throughout the night, invited prostitutes to home and <a href=# rel>drug overdosed</a> at their family home, reports the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>The couple was in the middle of their divorce proceedings, and on November 1, Vera and Andrei requested the court to lift the ban from the protective order. This joint request was made on her agreeing to let her husband return back to home and visit their children. Based on their request, Judge Marnie Slavin expressed that she “strongly advised against the arrangement,” through a handwritten note in addition to agreeing to lift the ban.</p><p>Weeks after the proceeding, on November 30, the Village of Buffalo Grove of Illinois announced on Twitter that they found five dead bodies of a family in their home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois during a welfare check.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei, his mother Lilia Kisliak, 67, his wife Vera, 36, Vivian Kisliak, 6, and Amilia Kisliak, 4, were stabbed to death from "sharp force injuries." The authorities call the gruesome deaths of the family members a domestic-related homicide.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Daily Mail, the court documents show that since July when Vera filed the divorce, Andrei exhibited aggressive behavior and conduct toward his family members. Vera allegedly told that her husband stalked her and took away her car while she dropped their children at school. He later threatened to murder her and he would disfigure her. She also claimed that Andrei was involved in drug abuse wherein he had marijuana intake and used cocaine on a daily basis.</p><p>The final proceeding of their divorce was to take place a day before the family members were found dead in their home at 2830 Acacia Terrace in a northwest suburb of&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5iesKKzzmakmqZdrLWwecqio6WdlGKzornIpbBmpZWir6a%2B0maYp5xdnbauv8SlnWaklZyurbjYZpmapp6asW6y0aikZqCforJuuc6nq6FlkpqzsL7EZp%2BopZmYtqWx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-jolie-my-voice-may-be-sexy-but-i-hate-how-i-sound.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angelina Jolie: My Voice May Be Sexy But I Hate How I Sound!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carmen-xtravaganza-cause-and-death-paris-is-burning-icon-dies-of-lung-cancer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carmen Xtravaganza Cause And Death: Paris Is Burning Icon Dies Of Lung Cancer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
