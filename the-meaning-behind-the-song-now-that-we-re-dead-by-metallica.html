However, Lars Ulrich, the drummer of Metallica, revealed how they came up with the concept while speaking with Rolling Stone magazine. He stated that the talking point was about a relationship that had gone sour, but with the two individuals still feeling possessive for each other. Ulrich described it as having a “relationship, where both parties owned pieces of each other, and as time goes by, they couldn’t live with nor without that person.” This narrative played an integral role in developing the lyrics of the song.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics_of_%E2%80%9CNow_That_Were_Dead%E2%80%9D></span>The Lyrics of “Now That We’re Dead”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Metallica has always taken pride in their lyrics. They often tell tales of love, loss, and anger through their songs. “Now That We’re Dead” is no different. The lyrics are hauntingly beautiful and depict the struggles of living for someone even after they are long gone.</p><p>The opening verse to the song is a clear indication of the emotional turmoil that the song speaks of:</p><p>“When darkness falls, may it be<br>That we should see the light<br>When reaper calls, may it be<br>That we walk straight and right<br>When doubt returns, may it be<br>That faith shall permeate our scars”</p><p>The verses go on to describe how the protagonist is dependent on the person who is no longer present in their lives, wishing that the empty space in their heart could be filled by them. It’s almost as if they’re begging for the other person to come back:</p><p>“Will you swallow me?<br>Into the rifted scar<br>Singularity<br>Nexus of the spirits”</p><p>The chorus of the song is a rhythmic call that draws the listener in and reels them in. It’s an echo of the protagonist’s desperate longing for the person who has left them behind:</p><p>“World on fire, only one, desire<br>Everything I am, everything I want to be<br>World on fire, only one, desire<br>One true, everything I need”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Tone_Sound_and_Production_of_%E2%80%9CNow_That_Were_Dead%E2%80%9D></span>The Tone, Sound, and Production of “Now That We’re Dead”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When listening to “Now That We’re Dead,” one cannot help but appreciate the beauty within the track. It starts with a somber tone that eventually morphs into a more upbeat one as the song progresses, surprising its listeners. The sound of the song is a blend of old-school thrash metal with a touch of modern rock. The guitars are heavy, and the drums are fast-paced with a tempo that’s designed to excite the listener.</p><p>The producer of the song, Greg Fidelman, has a meticulous attention to detail. According to Ulrich, Fidelman would insist that every instrument in the song had to be clean and precise. Such meticulous attention paid off, as the final product is an excellent example of how quality production can enhance an artist’s work.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Message_and_Meaning_Behind_%E2%80%9CNow_That_Were_Dead%E2%80%9D></span>The Message and Meaning Behind “Now That We’re Dead”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The meaning behind “Now That We’re Dead” is a universal one – the struggles of letting go of someone who has already left you behind. The song captures the feeling of helplessness, the realization of one’s dependence on another person, and the fear of facing life alone. It relates to the struggles we all face in life, in different degrees.</p><p>For some, “Now That We’re Dead” will be seen as a wake-up call, an acknowledgment that holding on to the past will only lead to misery. However, the message is open to interpretation, and every listener can take away something unique from the song.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Reaction_of_Fans_to_%E2%80%9CNow_That_Were_Dead%E2%80%9D></span>The Reaction of Fans to “Now That We’re Dead”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans have never been shy about expressing their love for Metallica, but when it comes to “Now That We’re Dead,” the reaction has been widespread.
