For those who don‚Äôt know her backstory, her parents wanted nothing to do with her and sister when they were kids so they dropped her off with her Grandma and never looked back, and then in 2017 she comes to LA to try to revive Spectra Fashions (Her great aunt Sally‚Äôs fashion house) which started off as a super fun storyline, it was nice to see B&B going back to its roots, only to have the character Bill Spencer take it all away from her and commit arson on the building because he wanted the building for himself (which never even ended up happening), while working at Spectra fashions she dated Thomas Forrester, they were great together, had amazing chemistry only for them to be broken up leaving Sally devastated because Thomas got back with his ex Caroline. Then she started a romance with Wyatt, which was also great, amazing chemistry, very fun couple only for them to once again destroy that pairing too by throwing Sally under the bus and making her a villain against Wyatt‚Äôs ex-girlfriend by kidnapping her and holding her hostage and of course Wyatt ended up reuniting Sally‚Äôs victim the ex-girlfriend in the end leaving Sally out in the cold again. Then she comes to Genoa city for a fresh start and gets involved with Jack/Summer/Kyle, got a job at jabot only for her to once again be written as a villain plotting with Tara to make Summer go away, which resulted in her being fired from Jabot and Jack ending his relationship with Sally and never interacting with her again after that and being shunned by Lauren/Summer/Kyle. Then she finds a new circle for another fresh start, (Adam, Nick, Chelsea, Chloe) which of course starts off with Chelsea bullying and bashing Sally at any chance she gets with Tried pushing herself on Adam with Adam acting like he wanted nothing to do with her at first, Sally finally gets her wish and Adam begins a romance with Sally which was great, only for her to cheat on him with his brother and later get pregnant needing a paternity test, Adam ends up being the father, they come up with a great, meaningful name for the baby honoring Adam‚Äôs mother only for the baby to die. She can never catch a break, it‚Äôs sad at this point seeing a character as depressing as her. She has so much potential, Adam can help her re-open Spectra Fashions in Genoa City so she can do what she originally wanted to do, which is to revive Spectra Fashions and continue her great aunt Sally‚Äôs legacy.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>All true. The way she was written on Bold and Beautiful was so much fun at first, then Bill Spencer just had to have the building she was in so he could tear it down, etc. I would love to see the real Sally Spectra, sass, brass, and all, rise from the ashes once again and come in for a big win. I think CBS soaps miss the mark because they pretty consistently write so that the wealthy characters are always winners and the not wealthy are always ultimately losers, even though they start out with a lot of promise. The odd thing about having Sally lose out to Flo in the Bold and Beautiful is that the actress portraying Flo wound up with such an active career that she hardly appeared and eventually disappeared from what I heard. Eventually the actor portraying Wyatt was let go and I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing now, which is a shame because he was a fun character. Maybe he will appear on GH.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>But that was then, this is now. And at least Sally will be on today, unlike Elena.

I still fast ff her when she comes on screen. She is a boring character to me!! When she first started it was ‚Äúover the top acting‚Äù, then running to Jack, Adam then Nick then back to Adam. It has completely turned me off of her especially when she lost her child and she blamed Adam. I mean what is the point now she has no real direction and I for one am over her!!!</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I enjoy Sally‚Äôs friendship with Audra and her relationship with Adam too. But I am hoping she is included in a professional SL too. It might be interesting to see her at NE and in conversations that don‚Äôt involve Connor.</p><p>after the way victor treated sally I would be disappointed if she ever worked there.</p><p>Sally has been working since she got to Genoa City. I can‚Äôt imagine she is suddenly going to become a woman of leisure.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>These writers do weird things.</p><p>Sally had her new interior design business and at first she was supposedly doing well then, all of a sudden, she wasn‚Äôt doing well and was looking around to see what she could do next.</p><p>We had that little interlude where Adam tried to get Victor to bring her into NE again, which didn‚Äôt go anywhere, as I think we all knew it wouldn‚Äôt, and then‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶</p><p>We haven‚Äôt, as far as I‚Äôve seen, heard anything about her business, or how she is paying her bills, or if she is planning something new. So what was the purpose of that little interlude about her business not doing well. If they didn‚Äôt have the interest or didn‚Äôt want to spend time on a story about it then why bring it up at all. They could have just left her running a supposedly successful enough design business in the background, but no, they had to start another story thread that they then just abandoned leaving us all with questions.<br>It‚Äôs just weird and bad writing IMO.</p><p>Unless I totally missed something because I haven‚Äôt been watching religiously but I have been following on here and didn‚Äôt read anything about her business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvRnp6aqpSeu6h50pqjpbFfbX94fZdt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./facts-you-should-know-about-the-iconic-album-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Facts You Should Know About The Iconic Album Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rauf-aregbesola.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Rauf Aregbesola</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
