He played pigeon-toed Eddie (a former serviceman of the Vietnam War) in 2020’s American war drama film Da 5 Bloods.</p><p>In fact, Norm revealed because Eddie being pigeon-toed was one of the reasons why director Spike Lee knew he would be perfect for the role.</p><p>“We’ve known each other for a long time; I think he saw Porgy and Bess five times.

He knew that I had gone through some physical deformity for a year being in Porgy and Bess.”</p><h3><strong>Norm Lewis Net Worth</strong></h3><p>With an impressive theater, film, as well as television resume, Norm Lewis had already amassed an estimated $3 million net worth before 2018 (as per the Celebrity Net Worth report).</p><p>Throughout this journey, he appeared all over Europe, on Broadway, in film, television, recordings, and regional theatre.
