He has been with the team since 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There is not much information about Devonn except for the fact that he also used to play football. He played&nbsp;college football&nbsp;at Norfolk State.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Devin Singletary.

While discussing Father's Day plans, he revealed Devonn was also nicknamed Motor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The NFL player said he was called Motor Jr. growing up, and Devonn was&nbsp;Motor. But now, Devin jokingly calls his father Motor or Big Motor, but usually, he simply refers to Devonn as 'dad.'</p><p>Devin also opened up about his son getting the same nickname. His son was called M3 by most of his friends because he is "Motor the Third." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Buffalo Bills player's mother and father are no longer together. His mother, Sabrina Clark, is currently married to his stepfather, Keith Clark, and has adopted his last name.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it seems like Devin is on good terms with Kevin.

He gave little details about the shooting but said everyone was alive except his big brother, GB.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Is Devin Singletary Related to Mike Singletary?</h2><p>Many people think that Mike Singletary is Devin's dad since the two share the same last name. However, the two are not <a href=# rel="follow noopener">related</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There is very little in common between them, except&nbsp;they have&nbsp;the same last name and are excellent football players.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Devin Singletary.
