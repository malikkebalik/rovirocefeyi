While studying at Kent University Saban played football in the position of defensive back in the Kent State team (1970–1971). He was not thinking about the position of the coach until his own coach Don James appointed him to the position of graduate assistant coach, a position he worked in from 1972 to 1974. Later, he was promoted to assistant coach and held this position while working at Kent State (1975–1976), Syracuse (1977), West Virginia (1978-1979), Ohio State (1980–1981), Navy (1982), Michigan State (1983–1987) and Houston Oilers (1988–1989).</p><p>In 1990, Nick Saban ws appointed the head football coach for the Toledo Rockets football team, but after a season he resigned, and went to the defensive coordinator’s position for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL), serving from 1991 to 1994. Since 1995, Saban has worked only in the position of head coach, from 1995 to 1999 with the Michigan State team; from 2000 to 2004 with the LSU Tigers football team; from 2005 to 2006 with the Miami Dolphins; and since 2007 he has been training the team of Alabama.
