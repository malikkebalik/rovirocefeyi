The rapper posted a few pictures of himself which showed him looking a bit bigger around the waist which led to the internet roasting him about his 'auntie hips.' Lil Baby hasn't responded to all those comments and anyway, it doesn't even look like he had weight gain in other pictures and it may just have been the camera angle after all.</strong></p><p><strong>Lil Baby</strong> rose to mainstream fame after the release of his mixtape Perfect Timing in 2017. He only continued to get bigger as his career progressed with time. The <a href=#><strong>rapper</strong></a> cashed in on the success of his mixtape and released his debut studio album Harder Than Ever the following year, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 single Yes Indeed (with <strong>Drake</strong>).</p><p>He also released two more mixtapes the same year which went on to be a commercial success. In 2020, he released his sophomore album My Turn which peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200. In 2021, he released a collaborative album The Voice of the Heroes which also topped the chart. He was featured on the song Hurrican by <strong>Kanye West</strong> along with The Weeknd which won him the Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance.</p><p>Currently, it's not his music that has started conversations about him. It's his weight gain. Ever since he posted that picture of himself in which he was looking bigger in the waist area, everyone has been trolling him about his hips. Let's discuss Lil Baby's weight gain!</p><p>You might also be interested in the <strong><a href=#>weight gain</a></strong> stories of&nbsp; <a href=#><strong>Tracy Ann Oberman</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Princess Charlene</a></strong>.</p><h2>Did Lil Baby Undergo Weight Gain? Maybe But Just on the Hips!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/lil-baby-pic2.jpg alt="Lil Baby seems to have had a weight gain in one of his recent pictures. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lil Baby seems to have had a weight gain in one of his recent pictures.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Yahoo Sports</strong></p><p><strong>Lil Baby</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lilbaby</a>) appears to have undergone a slight weight gain and it has got everyone talking about it because, in a way, it feels more scandalous and gossip-worthy than the things he has done recently like <a href=# rel=noopener>fathering a child with an IG model</a>, though in a totally unserious way.</p><p>Lil Baby may have had minor weight fluctuations and his weight loss might have once been a topic of discussion but it should be noted that when it comes to his weight, he hasn't ever been extreme. He looks of average weight and even with insignificant little changes, he has looked to be of average size. So, his recent weight gain should not have been as big a deal as it is now because it's nothing significant.</p><p>But the worst has happened and it's not just a figure of speech because for Lil Baby, with the way people are coming for him in the comment section of his Instagram posts, it might just be the worst even though it might seem hilarious to the bystanders. Or he could just be unbothered about the whole thing but his weight gain and people's reaction to it have made headlines that he may not have wanted.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/lil-baby-pic.jpg alt="Lil Baby looked a little wider in the hips area which led to him getting roasted on social media about it. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lil Baby looked a little wider in the hips area which led to him getting roasted on social media about it.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: GoldDerby</strong></p><p>Anyway, it all started with a picture Lil Baby posted on Instagram. He looked a bit different and a bit bigger. It was exactly like he gained weight but just on the hips. Yeah, it's not like he had an overall weight gain just around the waist which led to the internet roasting him in his comment section and <a href=# rel=noopener>making fun of him for having 'auntie hips.'</a> If he had not noticed that he looked a little rounder in that area when he posted that photo, then the internet was more than kind enough to let him know.</p><p>But Lil Baby's followers did not show any kindness to him as they roasted him for his weight gain. They really didn't hold back and it showed. One comment that said, "they sayin you got a BBL," had everyone wheezing. Another one referenced his 4PF crew in their jokes and wrote,</p><p><strong>They said you built like finesse in the first pic. I told them you just had 4pockets full.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/lil-baby-pic3.jpg alt="Lil Baby hasn't responded to the comments about his weight gain on the hips. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lil Baby hasn't responded to the comments about his weight gain on the hips.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: AP News</strong></p><p>Another agreed with the 4PF reference and said that it was either that his 4 pockets were full or that he was getting wide. One follower just commented that Lil Baby was not bullsh*tting on the dinner table and another wrote that he went from being a lil baby to a big momma house. Yeah, if you are not him, his weight gain must have been entertaining because of all the comments that just crack you up.</p><p>Granted, Lil Baby might not have felt the same about it. If he's bothered about it, he has not shown it. The rapper has not responded to the comments about his weight gain and so, if fans were looking to know how he gained weight on the hips, well, they can't unless he does. And anyway, it does not even look like he is bigger around his waist in other pictures of him. Was it just something to do with camera angles that made him look like that? Because he looked like he usually looked in other images of him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGijoqRdl66jxYywnKKfmKl6qK3Ip2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./an-american-journalist-t-j-holmes-married-marilee-fiebig-holmes-after-first-unsuccessful-marriage-w.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An American Journalist, T.J Holmes Married Marilee Fiebig Holmes After First Unsuccessful Marriage W</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-cowell-breaks-silence-on-agt-star-archie-williams-who-was-wrongfully-jailed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Cowell Breaks Silence on AGT Star Archie Williams Who Was Wrongfully Jailed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./video-filtrado-de-julieth-d%C3%ADaz-en-twitter-juliethofl-en-tiktok-ver-the-talks-today.html>Video filtrado de Julieth Daz en Twitter; Juliethofl en TikTok (Ver) The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-drew-allar-be-penn-state-s-breakout-blue-chip-qb-past-nittany-lions-detail-ups-downs.html>Will Drew Allar be Penn States breakout blue-chip QB?
