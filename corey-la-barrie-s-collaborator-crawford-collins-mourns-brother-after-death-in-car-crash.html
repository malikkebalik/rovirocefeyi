Corey was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>killed in a car crash</a> on his 25th birthday on Sunday (May 10), and Crawford felt it was time to break his silence on the horrific loss. “From the 1st day, I met you you’ve done nothing but push me to be a better person and help me out any chance you had. Anytime I needed help with a video or had no money to call an uber or needed a place to stay, you were always the 1st one to help me out, and the same would go for any of your friends that needed the same.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You are the perfect example of a supportive friend and what everyone is saying about you supports that 1000x over,” continued Crawford, who shared a picture of him and Corey laughing together. “You always lived life to the fullest (even though it often got us into some trouble) and those memories we share I will cherish forever. I’m gonna miss you yelling at me to ‘edit the video!’ or you asking me ‘did you send in the footage?’ and I wish more [than] anything that we could have accomplished all the big plans that we had for the future. But I take comfort in knowing how many people you impacted positively in such a short time, and because of that, your legacy will live forever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’ve never been much of a writer, and I could speak for hours about how much you’ve impacted me and everyone around you, but I’ll end this one here. You’re a legend bro. Love you always,” concluded a heartbroken Crawford. The two YouTube stars shared a home together (along with influencers <strong>JC Caylen</strong> and <strong>Chelsey Amaro</strong>) and started a joint channel (“Corey & Crawford”) in 2019. They had over 100,000 subscribers at the time of Corey’s death.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Corey, you were my brother/best friend/channel partner and one crazy motherfucker.

His death was confirmed by his brother, <strong>Jarrad La Barrie</strong>. “My brother Corey passed away last night in a car accident with his drunk friend driving… this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do,” he wrote on Instagram.” The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a> that the crash occurred at the corner of Huston Street and Carpenter Avenue in North Hollywood around 9:39 p.m. local time.
