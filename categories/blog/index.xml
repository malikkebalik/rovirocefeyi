ジャニーズ時代にはNEWSに所属し、現在でも当時からの隠れファンもいます。
女性のファンの多さで言えば、ワンオクの中でもダントツだと言えます。
正直、女性など選び放題のTAKAさんですが、決めた彼女というのは存在してるのでしょうか？
特に現在、まさに今の彼女とは、どこの誰で、どういった女性なのでしょうか？
過去、噂になった女性は、美人や芸能人やかなりハードルが高いですが・・。
今日は過去から現在までのTAKAさんと噂になった女性と、正式に交際してた彼女に関してまとめて書いてみたいと思います。
ワンオク・TAKAの歴代・彼女&amp;amp;熱愛の噂になった女 TAKAさんは2003年にNEWSとしてデビューし、すぐに女性問題を起こしました。
当時からTAKAさんを知ってる方は、このイメージが強くTAKA＝遊び人のようなイメージを持っているようです。
2018年頃に浅田舞さんがTAKAさんにぞっこんで、結婚するために仕事をセーブしていた際には、”どうせすぐに捨てられるのに”とファンとは思えない冷ややかなコメントが多くありました。
それほどに、TAKAさんの女癖は悪い印象があるみたいです。
しかし、遡ってみると、Takaさんが女性に対して酷いことをしたようなスクープは一度もなく、噂になる女性が多い&amp;amp;すぐ別れるということ意外に悪い印象はありません。
2003年 一般人の女性（学生同士？） 写真流出 2008年 鈴木えみ Alexの不祥事で破局？ 2011年 perfume・あーちゃん ガセ。同じ事務所。 2013年 藤井美菜 高校時代の同級生で過去に噂。復縁はガセ？ 2013年 森矢カンナ 目撃情報多数で有力 2013年 山本彩 ガセ。面識なし 2015年 前田敦子 ガセ。ただの釣り仲間 2016年 エミリー・ラッド ガセ。海外の友達の妹。 2017年 ローラ ガセ。親友関係 2018年 浅田舞 結婚秒読みも惜しくも破局 2003年頃の一般女性。当時NEWSメンバーだったTAKAは脱退。ポッキーゲームやキス写真流出 TAKAさんは2001年の中学一年生の頃にジャニーズに入所。
2003年の中学3年の頃に「NEWS」としてデビューが決まりました。
しかし、デビューしてからすぐに雑誌に一般人の彼女とラブラブしてる写真が載せられてしまいます。
チューしてるプリクラや、彼女とポッキーゲームしてる写真が流出してしまいました。
中学3年生にしてこのスキャンダルはイカついですね、さすが未来のロックスターです。
結局、TAKAさんは同年12月に活動休止、そしてジャニーズを退所することとなります。
2008年の鈴木えみとTAKAの交際。メンバーの不祥事で破局 2008年6月の週刊誌「女性セブン」にて、Takaさんと鈴木えみさんの交際が報じられました。</description></item><item><title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Blow Your Mind (Mwah) by Dua Lipa</title><link>/the-meaning-behind-the-song-blow-your-mind-mwah-by-dua-lipa.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-meaning-behind-the-song-blow-your-mind-mwah-by-dua-lipa.html</guid><description>Dua Lipa is a British singer and songwriter who has taken the music industry by storm with her powerful voice and relatable lyrics.
