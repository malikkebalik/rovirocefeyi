He&nbsp; stated in his post that:</p><p>Came into work to some really horrible news, Bob Schifellite has passed away early Monday morning…! First and foremost Bob was one of the pioneers that started Broadridge…! Bob was also a very outgoing guy that appeared to be interested in getting to know the people around him. In 2019 I was fortunate enough to get on that list, being on a first name basis and having random conversations as we passed each other in the halls. Our conversations were as if we were at a BBQ just getting to know each other. I had to pinch myself every so often to see if it was real. So as you can see developing this “friendship” was very special to me as well as motivating. Cause if I happened to bump into Bob, I’d have to be ready with an impressive update to share with him! It’s a shame that you were diagnosed only 3 weeks ago. RIP Bob! I hope to continue to impress you as you watch from above… Until we meet again!</p><p>Broadridge, a globally recognized Fintech leader with revenues exceeding $6 billion, plays a vital role in the financial industry by providing essential infrastructure to support investment, corporate governance, and communications.
