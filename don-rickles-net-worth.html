Deep down, they’re just regular people. Like Larry King. We’ve been friends for forty years. He’s one of the few guys I know who’s really famous. One minute he’s talking to the president on his cell phone, and then the next minute he’s saying to me, ‘Do you think we ought to give the waiter another dollar?”&nbsp;<strong>– DonRickles&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We were Orthodox Jews, but we really didn’t deserve it. I mean, bacon – my father said, ‘Don’t put bacon in the house,’ but we had bacon. We didn’t keep kosher. And we observed which today would be Conservative Jews. But in those days, we belonged to an Orthodox temple. So we made out we were Orthodox Jews, but we really weren’t.”&nbsp;<strong>– DonRickles&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“My mother was a big influence. She kept pushing me because I was very shy and inhibited. And schoolwork was very difficult for me because I couldn’t concentrate. I was failing almost every subject. To this day, I’m not too good at reading a book. But I was the president of my high school comedy group, and they treated me like a king.”&nbsp;<strong>– DonRickles&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Sinatra had a lot of mood swings, but he was wonderful to my wife Barbara and to me. He made no bones about who he liked and who he loved, and he had this great charisma. When he walked into a room, it stopped. I’ve only seen that happen with Ronald Reagan.”&nbsp;<strong>– DonRickles</strong></p><p>“At 90, I’m still working a couple of dates a month. My mind is very sharp on the stage, so why not? This may sound corny, but I do it because people – young and old – still come to see me, and they’re very enthusiastic about my work. They treat me like the Godfather.”&nbsp;<strong>– DonRickles&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Don Rickles’ Biography Summary</h2><p>Many people were inspired by Don Rickles’ work as a comedian, actor, and book during his career.
